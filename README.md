# Tetris
## Requirements:
- familiarize with Pygame library            # done
- use keys to move and turn obstacles around # done
- displaty current score                     # done
- increase pace and level over time          # done    
- function to hold obstacle for later        # done
- function to pause game                     # done

## Things to do:
- ! change variable and method names 
- improve hold function (can be used multiple times)
- improve level system
- !! docstrings
- bag system (random figures)
- movement options when at ground

## Extras
- instructions pause
- user name
- start from higher level
- highscore
- music volume

## Questions:
- how much compared to original tetris
- what should be in the class and what in main

## Project Documentation (~2 pages):
First of all: don’t confuse this with the documentation in your code. You should write your
code readable, with docstrings and comments that explain what happens (if they are actually
improving the readability, if you are unsure having more comments won’t hurt). Additionally
we ask from you a project documentation of around 2 pages.
The project documentation has to include a readme that explains how your code can be
used (additional modules that have to be downloaded beforehand, command for executing
the program, reusable functions if you have and so on).
For more details on what to include apart from the readme, have a look at the table.

Some points to focus on:
Programming Journey
What additional things (libraries, paradigms, etc) did you learn during the
project?
- pygame
What challenges did you face?
How did you approach them?
What further additions could be made
Show us your results
e.g. screenshot from your game, most important plot, ..

## Code Quality:
This part is mostly concerned with the style. You should by now know what is expected. If
you are unsure at some points, have a look at the respective PEPs.

## Pythonic:
This part is somewhat vague. In programming and especially in python you often have to find
a tradeoff between readability, efficiency, structure and codelength. Also your projects might
be very different and not every paradigm you learned will be useful in every project. If there
never is any user input, there is nothing to handle (we don’t ask you to do exception handling
in other cases). Does an object oriented structure help to improve the overview and code
length? Do I use a loop for readability or is list comprehension more idiomatic at a certain
point? Try to make meaningful decisions which paradigms you use at what point.

## In General:
Use the table as an orientation and try to make meaningful decisions. If you feel like you
deviate from what we request, but it makes more sense that way or you don’t manage to do
it differently, comment on that in your project documentation. If there are still open questions,
try to get them answered at the last two coding support sessions. Afterwards we cannot give
a guarantee on how much support we can still give you. You can of course always write an
email afterwards, but since there is a deadline, try to ask questions as early as possible.

## Points:
There will be a total of 100 points that you can reach in the project. Your bonus points from
the homeworks will be added afterwards. So if you achieve 80/100 points in the project and
have 6 bonus points from homeworks, we will give a grade for 86/100 points. If you reach
100/100 points in the project and have 10 bonus points, you get a 1.0 anyways
